# Frechet-Inception-Distance-pretrained-Inceptionv3-for-GAN-evaluation
Evaluating GAN model using FID (Frechet Inception Distance) on extracted features of Inception v3 classifier.
Calculate distance between embeddings of real and fake images. These embeddings are represented as multivariate Normal distribution.
lower the FID better the generated image is.
